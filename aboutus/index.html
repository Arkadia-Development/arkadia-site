							Deuce Black was the main backend and logic engineer for this site, and he also wrote an app for Shea's phone so it's easy to keep track of which cabinets are live and which aren't
							(see the <a href='/gamestatus'>game status page</a>).
							He's been visiting the arcade regularly since he moved to Fayetteville back in 2019 for college.
							He graduated with his bachelor's degree in computer science in May 2022 and is now a full-time software engineer at RXNT.
							Outside of work, he likes bouldering, playing with his dog, video games, D&D, Magic the Gathering, hiking, and basically anything else that doesn't involve the ocean.
							You can find his other work, including code, music, creative writing, and links to his professional socials, on
								<a href='https://dlblack.dev' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>his website</a>.

							Drew Smith was the main frontend and design engineer for this site.
							He's a fairly new addition to the arcade's crowd, but he had the ambition to spot the missing website niche and attempt to fill it.
							After graduating with his undergrad degree in Computer Science from the Univeristy of Arkansas, he joined J.B. Hunt Transportation as a software engineer.
							In his free time he enjoys going to the arcade, as well dungeons and dragons with friends, watching sports, and spending time with his family and dog.

			A whole lot of work went into making this site a reality!
