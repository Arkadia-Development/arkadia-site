                        <p>A Long Long Time Ago in a Galaxy far far away (wait thats how good stories start right?) Anyway, once upon a time</p>
                        <p>Our story starts here, with one man. He who felt destined to run an arcade. (no literally thats his name)</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade, wanted nothing more than to make sandwiches. All he wanted to do with his life was become the worlds best sandwich artist. but then, one day, everything changed.</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade walked into a nondescript coffee shop that was founded in Seattle and spread like a virus across the country, and he saw what the Baristas were doing, and so he changed his mind.</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade no longer wanted a simple life of making sandwiches, he desired more, he desired, to run an espresso machine. but as fate would have it, he wouldn't do that either</p>
                        <p>after leaving the coffee shop, He who felt destined to run an arcade got in his car, and began to drive away, filled with dreams of running an espresso maching. But since he was busy daydreaming and not paying attention to the road, he hit a wizard.</p>
                        <p>As He who felt destined to run a arcade stopped his car and ran out to the wizard he hit, the mighty wizard ArcadeMaster69 stood up and proclaimed the following</p>
                        <p>"He who felt destined to run an Arcade! You shall not be a barista!"</p>
                        <p>"You shall not serve coffee on a plane, or on a train"</p>
                        <p>"you will not be a sandwich maker"</p>
                        <p>"you will not make sandwiches in a house, or near a mouse!"</p>
                        <p>"you have one sole destiny, which i now curse you with, you will forever run ARKADIA!"</p>
                        <p>with a flash of smoke, ArcadeMaster69 vanished and in his place was arkadia, and the He who was destined to run an arcade was forever locked in, since the year 2012</p>
