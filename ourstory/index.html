                        <h1>Restoring the balance</h1>
                    </div>
                        <p>One day this guy was at work and was all like, this sucks. So he quit and then realized after a couple months that nobody was paying him to sit on the couch and play Skyrim all day, so he started his own business.</p>
                        <p>Lots and lots of details happened in between all that, but then Arkadia Retrocade opened on November 10th, 2012. And now, even <b style='color:crimson;font-family:"Courier New";'>ERROR: Integer overflow detected. Stack trace ejected to logs.txt. Exiting...</b> years later, thanks to all of y'all's support of the place, Arkadia is Arkansas's first and biggest retro arcade ever.</p>
                        <p>More to come...</p>
                        <p>As the story unfolds...</p>
                        <!-- <p>A Long Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Not Far Away, In Fact It Might Have Been This One (wait that's how good stories start right?) Anyway, once upon a time...</p>
                        <p>Our story starts here, with one man: He who felt destined to run an arcade (no literally that's his name).</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade wanted nothing more than to make sandwiches. All he wanted to do with his life was become the world's best sandwich artist - but then, one day, everything changed.</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade walked into A Nondescript Coffee Shop That Was Founded In Seattle And Spread Like A Virus Across The Country, and he saw what the baristas were doing, so he changed his mind. Guess that's all it took.</p>
                        <p>He who felt destined to run an arcade no longer wanted a simple life of making sandwiches. He desired more, he desired to run an espresso machine. But as fate would have it, he wouldn't do that either...</p>
                        <p>After leaving the coffee shop, He who felt destined to run an arcade got in his car and began to drive away, filled with dreams of running an espresso machine. But since he was busy daydreaming and not paying attention to the road, he hit a wizard.</p>
                        <p>As He who felt destined to run a arcade stopped his car and ran out to the wizard he hit, the mighty wizard ArcadeMaster69 stood up and proclaimed the following:</p>
                        <p class='wizardspeech'><i>"He who felt destined to run an arcade - you shall not be a barista!"</i></p>
                        <p class='wizardspeech'><i>"You shall not serve coffee on a plane, or on a train!"</i></p>
                        <p class='wizardspeech'><i>"You will not be a sandwich artist!"</i></p>
                        <p class='wizardspeech'><i>"You will not make sandwiches in a house, or near a mouse!"</i></p>
                        <p class='wizardspeech'><i>"You have one sole destiny, which I now curse you with: You will forever run ARKADIA!"</i></p>
                        <p>With a flash of smoke, ArcadeMaster69 vanished and in his place was Arkadia, and He who felt destined to run an arcade was forever locked in, since the year 2012. The wizard's magic also changed his name to <i>'Shea'</i>, which like, is cool I guess.</p> -->
